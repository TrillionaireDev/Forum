<!-- Detailed explanation content -->
<div style="margin-top:12px; color:#e0e0e0; font-size:0.95rem; line-height:1.5;">
  <p>The idea for the DrugFreeInu Forum came from the decision to avoid the use of social media platforms for documentation. I wanted a place where progress updates and my thoughts could be organized in a way social media platforms couldn’t provide.</p>

  <p>Social media platforms often spread misinformation, rumors, and lies. By building this forum, anyone can obtain information about DrugFreeInu without questioning the accuracy and truthfulness of what is presented to them. By having the DrugFreeInu Forum read-only, nobody can be misled by statements written by someone not associated with DrugFreeInu.</p>

  <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>At this time, DrugFreeInu does not post on social media platforms.</li>
    <li>Information found outside of the DrugFreeInu Forum is to be considered false.</li>
    <li>The forum was built for anyone to easily obtain undeniable information about DrugFreeInu.</li>
  </ul>
